# Predictive-Modeling-of-COVID-19-Spread-Using-Linear-Regression.
Precise forecasting is essential as the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on economy and public health worldwide. This research forecasts future COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities using historical data and a straightforward linear regression model. Policymakers can use these forecasts to better organize appropriate actions, such as resource management or lockdowns. To create these projections, the project makes use of a Kaggle dataset that contains daily and weekly COVID-19 data, including case numbers and death rates.
