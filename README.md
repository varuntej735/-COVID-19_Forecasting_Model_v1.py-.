# Forecasting COVID-19 Trends Using Historical Data.
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global health and economies, necessitating accurate predictions for effective management. This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Kaggle's historical COVID-19 data, which includes case counts at country, state/province, and county levels, along with global statistics from Worldometer. By applying models such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the project forecasts daily and weekly trends in cases and hospitalizations to assist authorities in resource management and planning. Data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis have been carried out to ensure the model's reliability. This project highlights the role of data science in crisis response, offering actionable insights to stabilize communities and improve resource allocation through systematic, data-driven decision-making.
